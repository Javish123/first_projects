      "El conjunto de las pinturas murales de la ermita de la Vera Cruz de Maderuelo (Segovia) fue trasladado a lienzo en 1947 y reconstruido en el Museo del Prado lo más fielmente posible a su disposición original. Los muros de la capilla están decorados con figuras de ángeles, Apóstoles y escenas evangélicas, y los testeros presentan dos temas bíblicos: Bóveda, centro: El Pantocrátor sostenido por cuatro ángeles; lateral izquierdo: La Anunciación, Ángel turiferario, San Mateo y San Lucas. Lateral derecho: San Marcos, Ángel con rollo, ¿San Juan Evangelista?, Ángel turiferario, Ángel con libro, Santo obispo. Medios puntos: Caín (para algunos autores Melquisedec) y Abel presentan ofrendas al Cordero inserto en la Cruz, La creación de Adán y El Pecado Original. Muro izquierdo: Seis Apóstoles, La Magdalena unge los pies del Señor, Adoración de un Mago a la Virgen con el Niño; Muro derecho: Cuatro Apóstoles. Las figuras representadas, típicamente románicas, no tienen volumen ni profundidad y están delimitadas por unos simples contornos que dividen los espacios correspondientes. El estilo del artista ha sido siempre considerado muy próximo al Maestro de Tahull. \n",

      "('http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/13565', 'Bed rugs (referred to as \"ruggs\" during the late eighteenth century) are completely home-manufactured products. The wool yarn pile is needleworked (not hooked, as was once assumed) in running stitch on a base of handloomed wool or linen. Most often, the base is a wool blanket, the surface of which is entirely obscured by embroidery. All the wool used for making bed rugs such as the Museum\\'s two examples (13.207) was most likely shorn from local sheep. The fleeces were then washed, carded, spun, and dyed by the rug maker.Although a few extant bed rugs are embroidered with stitches that lie flat to the surface of the base, the majority have a looped pile that may have been either clipped or left uncut. Both of the Museum\\'s bed rugs have cut pile faces. The one illustrated here has some random loops left uncut: the unevenness of the surface seems to indicate that the loops were made without the aid of a reed to keep them at a uniform height and that the surface was clipped with a small scissors or blade.The bold, overscaled patterning of the typical bed rug is unlike most other embroidered bed coverings of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The thickness of the sewing yarns as well as the need to create a design that would be effective when made into pile contributed to the use of large motifs and to the pleasing appearance of the end result. The central motif of a bouquet of flowers growing from an undersized urn can be traced to the influence of the Tree of Life image commonly found on Indian palampores. The Tree of Life design inspired many quilt and coverlet makers, yet it was never used with such vigor as on bed rugs.This rug was acquired from the Jonathan Deming house in Colchester, New London County, Connecticut. The majority of bed rugs have been traced to Connecticut, but they were made throughout New England, and examples are known that range in date from the 1720s to the 1830s.')\n",

The tables are remarkable not only for their exquisite beauty but also because they are signed and dated masterpieces descended in the family of their original owner, Stephen Van Rensselaer IV of Albany. Commissioned by the New York City merchant William Bayard, the table was part of a larger purchase that included a nearly identical pair of card tables and two pier tables with gilded swan supports, wedding gifts for his daughters Harriet and Maria, who in 1817 married Stephen Van Rensselaer IV and Duncan Pearsall Campbell. The invoice for the Campbell pieces survives, revealing how expensive furniture from Lannuier's Broad Street shop was.

      "('http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/435868', 'This is probably the first in a series of five paintings that Cézanne devoted to peasants playing cards. Enlisting local farmhands to serve as models, he may have drawn inspiration for his genre scene from a seventeenth-century painting by the Le Nain brothers in the museum in his hometown of Aix. The Metropolitan’s picture was followed by a version twice its size, which includes the additional figure of a standing child at right (Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia). In the last three compositions, Cézanne continuously pared away details, focusing on just a pair of card players.', 'The Painting: In his mid-fifties and at the height of his career, Paul Cézanne began a series of paintings, drawings, and watercolors of card players. The unprecedented repetition of the theme of card players and the monumental scale at which he chose to work in two of the later canvases demonstrate the significance of the project for him. Cézanne referred to his five paintings of card players as \"souvenirs of the museums\" (Vollard 1990), as they were steeped in art historical references to paintings by past European masters. We know from his dealer Ambroise Vollard (1914) that \"every afternoon Cézanne would go to the Louvre or to the Trocadero to sketch the Old Masters.\" (Vollard [1914] first saw any of Cézanne’s work in 1892, at the time of the completion of The Met’s picture, which he bought from the artist seven or eight years later.) The younger painter Emile Bernard, for whom Cézanne was a role model, also noted the influence on the Provençal artist not only of paintings in the Louvre but also of engravings after paintings of major European predecessors (Bernard 1904).Technical analysis of The Met’s painting has revealed it as probably the first essay in the series, after single-figure studies, following critic Georges Rivière’s (1933) first identification of it as the first painting in the series. (For a discussion of the technical analysis, see below.) Preparatory works suggest that each of the peasant models posed individually in the studio and that Cézanne built this scene with four figures on his own from these studies (Ireson and Wright 2010). Paulin Paulet, a gardener at the Cézanne family estate Jas de Bouffan just outside Aix-en-Provence, posed for the figure on the left (Ireson and Wright 2010). We know from his daughter that he was paid five francs to pose (transcript of interview with Léontine Paulet, 1955, M. Provence Archive, Atelier des Lauves, according to Ratcliffe 1960). In addition to posing for The Met’s and the Barnes Collection’s (see Additional Images, fig. 1) pictures, Paulin Paulet also may have posed for the figure on the right in Cézanne’s three remaining two-character card-playing scenes in the Musée d’Orsay (see Additional Images, fig. 2), the Courtauld Gallery (see Additional Images, fig. 3), and a private collection (ca. 1892–96), as well as for his two versions of The Smoker (ca. 1890–91, Städtische Kunsthalle, Mannheim, and ca. 1890–92, State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg). Rivière (1933) identified the man with the pipe at the rear as \"le père Alexandre,\" a farmworker at Jas who posed for the Man with a Pipe compositions (see Additional Images, figs. 4, 5) as well as the card players series. The other models are unknown but are generally believed to be other workers on the family farm.Cézanne’s models posed for this scene at Jas de Bouffan, but the exact setting there is a mystery. According to Cézanne’s friend Joachim Gasquet (1921), the series was painted in the farmhouse kitchen on the Cézanne family estate, rather than the main house where he usually painted. Fritz Novotny (1937) also identified the setting as the estate, but Athanassoglou-Kallmyer (2003) qualified that identification by stating that it was a room in Jas de Bouffan \"made to appear like a tavern\"; she also promoted a connection between the subject matter and its placement in a tavern-like setting with new government restrictions on gambling in the 1890s and the very tangible threat, then, to card manufacturers of Provence (a cause taken up by a childhood friend of Cézanne’s, the socialist politician Victor Leydet). Cézanne’s native Provence actually was one of the oldest regions for the production of playing cards in France, and the act of card playing was a frequent pastime there.The Theme: In Cézanne’s hands, the notion of passing the hours by playing cards turns into a timeless subject. Contemporary critics saw the artist’s seriousness in presenting this theme and compared his work to that of the seventeenth-century Le Nain brothers, Caravaggio, and others. But, as John House (2010) has argued, the ambiguous setting and the lack of facial expression, communicative gestures, and anecdotal detail remove Cézanne’s images of card players from their precedents to something else again, something new. House noted that the painter used previous compositional arrangements but stripped forms of \"the chain of associative meanings that they carried in their previous incarnations.\" Removed from the more typical associations of baudy tavern life or moralizing tales, Cézanne’s cardplaying can be seen as a ritual that, in and of itself, evokes provincial life’s single long time frame with no beginning or end (House 2010).It was Gasquet (1921) who recalled Cézanne often examining Mathieu Le Nain’s The Card Players (see Additional Images, fig. 6) in the Musée Granet while growing up in Aix-en-Provence and exclaiming \"Voilà comment je voudrais peindre!\" (That is how I would like to paint!) Both the rear standing figure in The Met’s picture and both rear figures in the Barnes version recall the apparition-like figure at rear left in the Le Nain painting. A similar figure appears at the rear in Antoine Le Nain’s The Little Card Players (Les Petits Joueurs de cartes) (see Additional Images, fig. 7), which was acquired for the Louvre museum in 1874 (Ireson and Wright 2010). Both, too, can be seen as sources for Cézanne’s placement of his card players around a central table. Nancy Ireson (2012) stressed the importance of Cézanne’s childhood friend Antony Valabrèque as the painter’s conduit to the Le Nain brothers, as Valabrèque was an expert on the Le Nains, having devoted a study to their work that would be published years later (1904).Images of card players actually derive from Renaissance banquet scenes. While, traditionally, the subject has been associated with stories of swindlers in action, Cézanne’s picture avoids any such moralizing element. Not long before beginning his card players series, Cézanne made a painted copy of Dutch seventeenth-century master of peasant genre scenes Adriaen van Ostade’s (1610–1685) etching The Family (The Met, 23.65.30). (The copy of 1885–90 is in a private collection.) Cézanne’s interest in the inherent nobility of rural peasant subjects from his native Aix led him to focus on such images; the lessons he gained from the copying exercise included the sheer worthiness of peasant subjects, the value of a realist approach, and the importance of imposing a structure on any such given scene. While the nineteenth-century art world was firmly tied to a hierarchy that placed such peasant genre pictures considerably below religious and history painting, art-historical precedents such as Van Ostade gave Cézanne hope for another road to popular acclaim.Cézanne’s contemporary Ernest Meissonier (1815–1891) took up the call of seventeenth-century precedents in meticulous small-scale genre scenes with figures in period costume. His The Card Players (The Met, 25.110.39) of 1863, for example, took up the same subject as Cézanne but in an exacting detail contrary to the Provençal painter’s simplified forms. Art historians Kirk Varnedoe (1976) and Theodore Reff (1980) found other sources for Cézanne’s series in Gustave Caillebotte’s The Besique Game (Partie de bésique) (1880, private collection) and Jean-François Raffaëlli’s illustration from Joris-Karl Huysmans’ \"Les Habitués de café,\" in Les Types de Paris (Paris: Le Figaro, 1889). Caillebotte’s painting was exhibited in Paris in 1882, when Cézanne was there. In addition to the inclusion of a standing observing figure and a similar slightly downward point-of-view, Caillebotte’s picture shares with The Met’s painting a grander scale and quieter concentration among the figures than in the brawling tavern scenes of Dutch seventeenth-century genre precedents (Varnedoe 1976). (Caillebotte’s bezique players, however, reflect his own socio-economic group, whereas Cézanne’s card players, though very familiar from his daily surroundings at Jas, are quite apart from his own [House 2010].) (For more extensive discussions of the various art historical sources for The Met’s picture, see Reff 1980 and House 2010.)The Series and Technical Analysis: X-radiography (see Additional Images, fig. 8) and examination under infrared light have revealed many changes by the artist as well as accretions of paint in the areas of these changes. Heavier build-up of paint is visible around the shoulders, backs, and hats of the figures in The Met’s picture; Cézanne revisited these densely painted areas on multiple occasions over the two-year period in which he worked on this canvas. Cézanne made fewer changes on the version in the Barnes Collection. In the wake of scientific analysis, The Met’s smaller canvas, therefore, is now thought to precede the Barnes picture. The painter worked in a conventional manner, scaling up to work on a canvas almost two times the size of The Met’s picture for the Barnes version. Cézanne painted out the hat worn by the central figure in the Barnes version; after building up the area around the figure’s head with paint (visible in raking light), the artist chose to streamline the composition instead. He did, however, add the figure of Leontine Paulet, the gardener’s daughter, sitting on the rear right in the Barnes version. While the same pipe rack and golden curtain appear in both pictures, a bookshelf, olive jar, and gilt-framed picture on the wall behind the figures were all added to the larger canvas. The viewpoint differs slightly in each as well: it is as if the artist stepped back from his position in viewing the scene (or, really, inventing the scene) as found in The Met’s version to a broader view for the Barnes picture, which also grants more space around each figure.Technical studies have shown that the painter not only used various studies of individual figures in composing his five oil paintings but also \"rehearsed drawing his sitters before embarking upon more complex arrangements\" (Burnstock, Hale, Campbell, and Macaro 2010). This conclusion was based on a comparison of the studies with the graphite underdrawing visible in images of the final paintings under infrared light. The studies often were not drawn to the same scale as the paintings, so they were used as more general visual aids for the freehand underdrawings, not for transferring forms in a systematic fashion. (For greater information on the studies for The Met’s painting, see Ireson and Wright, eds. 2010). Adjustments to the compositions continued through the painting process, with re-drawing still visible over paint to define the edges of forms at points. It is because of this continued use of drawing into the painting stage that conservators have called Cézanne’s technique in this series \"unconventional\" (Burnstock, Hale, Campbell, and Macaro 2010). For Cézanne, the process of creating, like the activity of his cardplayers stuck forever mid-game, was an endless one.[Jane R.

Although they add an engaging element for the viewer, Goya may have intended them as a reminder of the frail boundaries that separate the child's world from the forces of evil, or as a commentary on the fleeting nature of innocence and youth. Manuel died at the tender age of eight.\", 'Goya’s portrait of Manuel Osorio Manrique de Zuñiga was already described in 1923 (Mayer) as \"perhaps the best\" of the artist’s portraits of children from the 1780s. Less than fifty years later, the painting had assumed iconic status and was considered \"one of the most appealing and successful portraits of children ever painted, and also one of the most famous\" (Virch 1967). This was in part due to Duveen’s sale of the highly publicized canvas in 1927 to Jules Bache, who had decided to acquire the portrait following the suggestion of his daughter Mrs. Gilbert Miller (Behrman 1952). A copy of the painting had also been included as part of the stage set in Henri Bernstein’s play La Galerie des Glaces which opened at the Théâtre du Gymnase, Paris, in October 1924. Bernstein had owned the portrait himself, from at least 1903 to 1925. For the celebrity of the painting in the twentieth century, see Reva Wolf, \"Goya’s \\'Red Boy\\'. The Making of a Celebrity,\" in Sarah Schroth, ed., Art in Spain and the Hispanic World: Essays in Honor of Jonathan Brown, London, 2010.On January 29, 1787 Goya was paid for a series of portraits for the Banco de San Carlos (current Banco de España), including a full-length one of the governor of the bank, Vicente Joaquín Osorio Moscoso y Guzmán, 12th Conde de Altamira (1756–1816) (Banco de España, Madrid). The success of this portrait prompted the count to commission other portraits of members of his family by Goya. These included images of his wife, María Ignacia Álvarez de Toledo Condesa de Altamira with her daughter María Agustina (MMA 1975.1.148), and of his two sons, Vicente Osorio de Moscoso, Conde de Trastamara (1777–1837; private collection) and Manuel Osorio Manrique de Zuñiga señor of Ginés. As stated in the inscription at the bottom of the painting, Manuel was born on April 11, 1784; he died at the age of eight on June 12, 1792 (for a biography of the members of the Altamira family, see Moffitt 1987). It is likely that all four Altamira portraits were painted between 1786 and 1788, and this is supported by the age of the sitters in each painting. It has been suggested that the portrait of Manuel may be posthumous and painted after 1792, but this seems unlikely, and a dating around 1787–88 would fit for a three or four-year-old boy. The portraits of Vicente and Manuel were accompanied by a third one of their middle brother, Juan María Osorio (1780–1785; Cleveland Museum of Art). The portrait, acquired by the Cleveland Museum as a Goya, and subsequently attributed to Augustín Esteve, is by an unknown artist but, as the inscription at its bottom proves, was a posthumous one painted after 1785. It is unclear if the anonymous painter who portrayed Juan María based his image on Goya’s one of Manuel, or if he established the prototype for the portraits of the two other brothers.In this portrait Manuel wears a red outfit, which has given the painting the nickname the \"Boy in Red\". He is accompanied by several pets. Attached to a string is a magpie that holds Goya’s calling card in its beak. To the right is a cage full of finches and to the left three cats. Manuel’s pets have been interpreted in several different ways. The caged birds are usually symbols of the soul and of innocence; the cats can be seen as forces of evil; for Virch (1967), \"all motion is suspended, but one can easily imagine all hell breaking loose in the next instant, when those monstrously intent cats, foreboding evil, jump at the magpie and tear apart the fragile birdcage, creating disorder and early sorrow. . . By introducing the dark forces of evil Goya gave poignancy to his portrayal of innocent youth.\" According to Chan (1980) the birdcage is a symbol of the confinement and protection of childhood, while the cats represent Fortune, Time, and Fate, and the magpie Destiny. The animals have also been seen as related to the iconography of Christ and his Passion (Pressly 1992) and to the educational views of the Enlightenment (Mena Marqués 2004). In general the animals fit within a larger visual tradition of children’s portraiture in Spain (Velázquez) and in England (Reynolds and Hogarth).[Xavier F. Salomon 2012]')\n",
      "('http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436573', 'This intense portrait depicts Fernando Niño de Guevara (1541–1609), who in 1596 was named cardinal and is dressed as such here. In 1599 he became Inquisitor General of Spain but resigned in 1602 to serve the rest of his life as Archbishop of Seville. The painting probably dates from the spring of 1600 when the cardinal was in Toledo with Philip III and members of the Madrid court. El Greco had lived in Venice and in the Farnese Palace in Rome, where Titian’s portraits (such as those of the Farnese Pope Paul III) would have revealed to the Greek painter the psychological possibilities of portraiture.', 'This celebrated picture—a landmark in the history of European portraiture—has become emblematic not only of El Greco but also of Spain and the Spanish Inquisition. Fernando Niño de Guevara, from a noble family of Toledo, rose to prominence under Philip II and was named cardinal in 1596. Here he wears a cardinal’s biretta (cap), mozzetta (cape), and rochet (the lace-trimmed garment). In April 1599 he was nominated as Inquisitor General by Philip III but served in that office for only two years, since the king’s favorite, the Duke of Lerma, was determined to place his own uncle in the cardinal’s position. To that end, evidently, Niño de Guevara was appointed Archbishop of Seville, which he remained until his death on January 8, 1609.The portrait was probably painted in March and April 1600, when the cardinal (aged about 59) was in Toledo for several weeks. His visit began as part of the king and queen’s formal entry into the city on March 2; a few days later an auto-da-fé was held at which Philip III vowed to protect the Holy Office and forty-six alleged transgressors were assigned unfortunate fates. The cardinal paused at Toledo briefly in 1601 and went there on family business in 1604, but the time required and other considerations make it unlikely that the portrait was painted at either of those later dates.Scholarly attention to the painting followed shortly upon its sale in 1904 from a noble collection in Madrid to the Museum’s great benefactors, Henry and Louisine Havemeyer. For the next eighty years the picture was discussed as a portrait of Niño de Guevara, an identification which must have descended with the work through eighteenth- and nineteenth-century collections. However, in articles of 1982 and 1984 Brown and Carr maintained that the sitter was not Niño de Guevara but his successor as Inquisitor General, Cardinal Bernardo de Sandoval y Rojas (1546–1618). Apart from minor works that depend directly on the present picture, no other portrait of Niño de Guevara is known. Sandoval, by contrast, appears in an Italian engraving of 1599 and in a posthumous portrait of 1619 by El Greco’s former pupil, Luis Tristán. There is some resemblance between the two men, but Sandoval does not wear glasses in the print or the painting of 1619, and his beard and mustache differ. In the engraving, the fifty-three-year old Sandoval appears younger and fuller in the face than El Greco’s figure. His glance is direct and expression congenial, as one might expect of Lerma’s mild-mannered uncle, who was known for his charity, liberal reforms, and literary interests. At the time, glasses suggested erudition, and the cardinal’s type of \"cord-spectacles\" was modern and fashionable. However, no one would have worn glasses in a formal portrait unless they were distinctive of their actual appearance.The identification of El Greco’s cardinal with Niño de Guevara is now widely accepted, and seems certain based on recent (2013–14) study of the picture’s early history and provenance. In 2003 Christiansen noted that the portrait may be traced back from the Oñate collection through the counts of Añover to Pedro Lasso de la Vega Niño y Guzmán (1559–1637), Count of Los Arcos, who was Niño de Guevara’s nephew and an ambitious collector of family portraits as well as portraits of important prelates and Spanish royalty. An inventory of the count’s collection, begun upon his son and successor’s death in 1632, records seven or eight paintings by El Greco, including the Museum’s View of Toledo and \"A portrait of the Cardinal Don Fernando archbishop of Seville. Inquisitor general seated in a chair. [valued] at 100 ducados.\" Brown and Carr attempted to explain away this first-known record of the painting by noting that the artist is not named (which is actually the norm in Spanish collections throughout the century) and by suggesting that someone outside the family may have bought the picture. But the consistent use of simple fractions (e.g., 3/5) used to reduce the appraiser Maíno’s estimates shows that the supposed sale of the collection was not a public auction but a fair distribution of goods among family members, which became necessary when Pedro Lasso’s son predeceased him. The count \"bought\" the cardinal’s portrait from his own collection and left it to his grandson and namesake, the second count of Los Arcos (1622–1699). The line of descent from his collection to 1904 is unbroken.There can be little doubt that Pedro Lasso not only owned the painting after the cardinal’s death in 1609 but commissioned it in the first place. The cardinal himself was not a collector and there is no trace of his portrait ever having been in Seville (for example, in his estate, the Cathedral, or the Archiepiscopal Palace). As majordomo to Queen Margarita and owner of the family palace in Toledo, the count would have played a major part in the state visit of 1600 and was likely his uncle’s eager host. On behalf of the family, Pedro Lasso maintained and amplified a large collection of portraits in their castle at Batres, between Toledo and Madrid. In addition to Spanish kings and queens, the subjects included great saints, recent popes, a recent Inquisitor General (Cardinal Diego de Espinosa; d. 1572), Saint Teresa of Ávila, other recent or living Spanish churchmen, and \"kinsmen of the lords of this house,\" such as the famous poet Garcilaso de la Vega and the count’s mother (the cardinal’s sister), Aldonza Niño de Guevara. Inspired by Saint Teresa, she founded a convent of Discalced Carmelites on family property at Cuerva and served as its prioress from 1585 until her death in 1604. Of the many members of the family who served the Spanish church or crown in the 1500s and 1600s none rose so high as Fernando Niño de Guevara, and this must have occasioned his nephew’s turn to El Greco.In style and expression El Greco’s painting is one of the most remarkable portraits ever painted in Spain, especially when one compares contemporary formal portraits by artists such as Juan Pantoja de la Cruz. It has often been noted that among the artist’s most important models were two superb portraits by Titian of Pope Paul III Farnese (both in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples), which appear to have inspired El Greco’s understanding of portraiture as characterization. One also finds in works by Titian such as the Charles V Seated, of 1548 (Alte Pinakothek, Munich), the use, as here, of a setting or background to expressive effect, which was intensified when translated into the stylized manner of Spanish court portraiture. Thus, the contrasting encounter of the silk brocade wall covering (not gilt leather) with the door and the unsettling recession of the tiled floor contributes to the impression of a dynamic and perhaps restless personality. The cardinal sits still but tensely, with slight levitation implied by dense shadow beneath the chair and drapery sweeping to the right. The difference between the hands is complemented by the forms around them, with the rectilinear section suggesting stability and the brocade agitation. At least one scholar has seen the hands (which for some viewers will recall Van Dyck and Grünewald) as evoking the alternatives of predatory discipline and the possibility of pardon. The accuracy of such speculations seems immaterial compared with the fact that El Greco’s treatment of the sitter gives rise to them.It has occasionally been wondered whether Velázquez may have had the cardinal’s portrait in mind when, in 1650, he painted his extraordinary portrait of Innocent X (Galleria Doria Pamphilj, Rome). This would have been unlikely if the El Greco was at Batres. However, Pedro Lasso also kept a select group of portraits (mostly of royalty and important family members) in his house in Madrid, and it is only there that the present picture was recorded during the seventeenth century. This is unsurprising, since the collection at Batres was mainly for the family alone, whereas the portraits in Madrid not only embodied family pride but also would have announced to visitors from the court and other noble houses that the counts of Los Arcos had a distinguished history and considerable influence.[Walter Liedtke 2014]')\n",

The church behind him, which does not seem to represent an existing church, may also be related to the cardinal in the painting. Most of the figures in this painting appear to be portraits of specific individuals. The attribution of the painting to Ottavio Leoni is a tentative one.', 'The picture shows a cardinal and his entourage processing in front of a church located on the outskirts of Rome, with a road that runs past a Roman ruin to a distant triumphal arch. The view would appear to be fictive, for no church façade responding to the one in the painting is known, but the personages are clearly intended to be recognizable. The function of the picture would seem to have been commemorative or celebrative rather than documentary in nature; the coat of arms displayed in the tympanum of the church is not identifiable and although the ruins might seem to recall the temple of Minerva Medica, it is only a generic resemblance. At the time the picture was given to the Museum a number of specialists in the field were contacted concerning both the attribution and possible identity of the figures (see departmental files for correspondence). Francesca Baldassari tentatively suggested as the artist the Florentine painter Anastasio Fontebuoni (1571–1626), who between 1599 and 1620 worked in Rome, where he was under the protection of cardinals Giustiniani and Arrigoni. If this is so, then the picture would have been painted in Rome during this stay. However, other scholars, including Adriano Amendola and Antonio Vannugli, have proposed, instead, Ottavio Leoni (1578–1630), who is known primarily as the author of exquisite portrait drawings of the leading personages in Rome, but who has also emerged in recent scholarship as a painter and is known to have worked on a miniature-like scale. The most recent book on the artist, by Francesco Solinas (2013), accepts the picture unquestionably as by Leoni but considers the identity of the various figures uncertain (at an earlier moment he had suggested the possibility that the picture evoked Cardinal Francesco Sacrati (1567–1623) with an allusion to taking possession of his titular church of San Matteo in Merulana). Alternatively, Amendola and Vannugli have suggested identifying the figure to the right of the cardinal as Ludovico Ludovisi (1595–1632), the nephew of Gregory XV and a patron of Leoni (Leoni’s drawn portrait of the prelate was executed in 1621; see Additional Images, fig. 1, for the engraving of 1628). Vannugli considers the identity of the cardinal and the other figures in attendance more problematic. The precise interpretation of this exquisite and fascinating picture thus remains very much an open question.In her study of the procedures by which cardinals took possession of their titular church, Cloe Cavero de Carondelet (2016) describes the picture as showing the cardinal preceded by his court barbiere or chamber assistant, who holds a mace. She suggests that the folded document held by the cardinal might be the apostolic bull that was read during the possession ceremony.[Keith Christiansen 2018]')\n",

      "('http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/459088', \"El Greco executed at least five paintings of Saint Jerome. In this version, from the last years of the painter's life, the saint is shown in the red vestments of a cardinal, seated before an open book, an attribute indicating his role as translator of the Bible from Greek into Latin in the fifth century. His gaunt sunken features and long white beard refer to his familiar guise as a penitent, recalling his retreat to the Syrian desert.. The painting is notable for the novel way in which the artist synthesized the two aspects of Saint Jerome, the scholarly and the ascetic.\", 'El Greco and his workshop produced several paintings of Saint Jerome as a scholar. The two finest are in New York: a signed canvas (110.5 x 95.3 cm) in the Frick Collection, probably of the 1590s, and the present picture, which is generally considered to be an autograph replica of the following decade. Christiansen (in New York-London 2003-4, p. 190) reports that a direct comparison of the two paintings in 2001 demonstrated that despite their closeness in design, their \"color harmonies and brushwork are strikingly different,\" and that the palette is paler and more brilliant in the Lehman version, and the execution broader. Similar differences in style are evident in El Greco’s portraits and religious pictures of the same decades.The portrait-like quality of the face has often been noted, and in the past led to identifications with known contemporaries of the artist (see J. Brown in Sterling et al. 1998, p. 174). It seems likely that El Greco referred to a live model but not to a person who was meant to be recognized as a prominent churchman or other public figure in Toledo. However, a scholarly prelate, of the sort known to have commissioned works from El Greco (such as Pedro Salazar de Mendoza; see The Vision of Saint John; MMA 56.48), would have been a potential client for a painting of Saint Jerome, especially one presenting him in such a straightforward manner, standing at a desk in private, with a thumb marking his place in a book. It has been suggested that the cardinal has been interrupted by the viewer, but this conceit, common enough in portraits of living scholars and collectors, is clearly implausible given his unfocussed glance to the side. Saint Jerome has paused to reflect deeply on what he has read in the Bible, surely his own Latin translation (the Vulgate) from the Greek.Saint Jerome (ca. 342–420), one of the Four Doctors of the Latin Church, was known for his outstanding classical education, and as a biblical scholar. The Order of Saint Jerome, the Hieronymites, was founded near Toledo in the 1300s, and by 1415 no less than twenty-five houses were established in Portugal and Spain. From the beginning the order enjoyed royal favor, as is seen in the majestic Jerónimos Monastery in the Belém parish of Lisbon, begun by Henry the Navigator about 1459 and continued by King Manuel I from 1501 onward, and San Jerónimo El Real in Madrid, founded by Isabella I in 1503. El Greco would have been most familiar with the Hieronymite monastery of San Pablo in Toledo, which in 1583 sold its church to the family of Fernando Niño de Guevara (see El Greco’s portrait of the later Cardinal-Archbishop; MMA 29.100.5).Hieronymite monasteries in Spain were well known for their traditions of contemplation and humanistic learning, and for their important libraries. Presumably, these considerations influenced El Greco’s characterization of the saint. The presentation of Saint Jerome as a scholar, familiar from Dürer’s famous engraving of 1514 and from a good number of Early Renaissance paintings, was still fairly common in the later 1500s and early 1600s, but he was very often depicted as a hermit or (a new notion in El Greco’s time) as an ascetic-scholar at a desk (as seen in paintings by Jacopo Bassano, Titian, and Caravaggio).Two paintings of Saint Jerome as a cardinal are listed in the 1614 inventory of El Greco’s studio, and two (probably the same) are cited in the 1621 inventory of his son Jorge Manuel’s possessions. In the latter, measurements are given, which correspond to 62 x 55 cm (no. 162) and 111 x 84 cm (no. 131). The larger picture could have been either the Frick’s or the Metropolitan’s picture, or yet another version.[Walter Liedtke 2014]')\n",

This landscape was not painted on site, but later in the artist’s studio where he experimented with the structure of his many pictures of Saint-Valéry-sur-Somme. The particularly ambiguous foreground and fractured elements in the background may result from the synthesis of two separate drawings sketched on site, the left half aligning with one sketch and the right another.

Its flat surface patterning, seemingly random yet carefully ordered placement of figures, dogs, and carriages, disquieting perspective, and insistent two-dimensionality all find counterparts in the drawings and prints of Nabi artists Edouard Vuillard and Pierre Bonnard, among others. The Nabis openly drew inspiration from Japanese woodblock prints, then all the rage in Paris.

The initial C introduces one of the responses for the celebration of the Office of the Dead: \"Credo quod redemptor meus vivit, et novissimo die terra resurrecturus sum, et in carnee mea videbo Deum, Salvatorem meum\" (I believe that my Redeemer lives, and that on the last day I shall rise from the earth and in my flesh I shall see God, my Savior). Inside the initial, the bust-length figure of Christ, his right hand raised in judgment, emerges from a bank of clouds set against a burnished gold background. To his right, an angel blows the trumpet of the Last Judgment. Below them, the dead emerge from cracks in the rocky ground, their hands clasped in prayer.Written and illuminated over a period of 135 years beginning in 1370, the choir books of Santa Maria degli Angeli represent the crowning achievement of the art of illumination in early Renaissance Florence. The early fifteenth-century campaign of decoration was led by Lorenzo Monaco, a monk in Santa Maria degli Angeli, and the preeminent painter and illuminator in Florence until his death in 1423 or 1424. The convincing presence of the figures and spatial recession within this miniature, reflecting the newest Renaissance style of painting, are typical of the artist\\'s illuminations throughout the series. According to the sixteenth-century biographer Giorgio Vasari, who described them as the most beautiful in all of Italy, the choir books were so admired by the Medici pope Leo X (r. 1513–21) that he had contemplated taking them for the Basilica of Saint Peter\\'s. The entire series originally consisted of around twenty volumes. Following the suppression of the monastery at the beginning of the nineteenth century, eighteen volumes were transferred to the Biblioteca Laurenziana in Florence (where they remain at present).

His method was to manipulate numerous small geometric solids that were cut and pasted from cardboard until a satisfactory arrangement emerged.  The small cardboard maquette, or sometimes a larger version of it, was then sent to the foundry to be enlarged and cast in steel.  The result often startled the artist, as the work loomed to monumental proportions.\\tSmith\\'s large black painted-steel sculpture \"Amaryllis\" exemplifies his style and suggests the expressive possibilities and visual intricacies that could be achieved with a relatively limited number of elements.  As in many of the artist\\'s pieces, a single geometric form (in this case, a tetrahedron forming a triangular-based pyramid) is repeated to create a larger, more irregular configuration.  In \"Amaryllis\" two of these composite forms, identical in size and shape, are joined together:  one piece is placed horizontally on the ground; the other extends vertically at an angle from the top.  As the viewer moves around the sculpture, its configuration changes constantly—stretching and contracting, balancing and unbalancing. This eccentricity of form reminded the artist of the unusual organic shape of an amaryllis plant.  Smith has often been associated with the Minimalist artists of the 1960s. Unlike them, he did not negate content, but was always receptive to the idea of abstract sculpture evoking objects and attitudes.', '')\n",

Beginning in the late 1960s, Gehry experimented with furniture made of composite layers of cardboard, yielding objects of substantial resilience and strength, while at the same time permitting considerable flexibility of form. The \"Contour\" chair, for example, features a fluid, ribbonlike shape that belies its sturdy structure. Gehry was particularly interested in creating well-designed, low-cost goods, and its standardized production and inexpensive materials made \"Contour\" an affordable piece of furntiture. The use of common industrial supplies such as cardboard characterized much of Gehry\\'s early architecture and design, as he sought to create a new formal vocabulary through everyday materials.', '')\n",
      "('http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/486411', \"Although it is unanimously agreed that Abstract Expressionism was the province of painters, one sculptor-David Smith-stands out as an important exception. Initially trained as a painter in New York City in the late 1920s to early '30s, he continued to paint and associate with painters (including Arshile Gorky, Adolph Gottlieb, Willem de Kooning, Robert Motherwell, and Jackson Pollock) even after he turned to sculpture in 1931. Like these painters, Smith espoused the role of spontaneity in the creative process, and viewed his mature creations (abstract welded metal sculptures) as representations of energy rather than mass.Starting in the late 1950s, and continuing until his death in 1965, Smith produced a unique series of preparatory studies for his sculptures that no longer relied on traditional drawing methods or tools. Instead of applying brush and ink to paper, he sprayed enamel paint over cutout pieces of cardboard or metal that had been arranged into a sculptural form on a sheet of paper. When the cutouts were removed, the unpainted paper color was revealed, silhouetted against a halo of spray paint. DS 1958 is one of the first studies of this type to be made and displays Smith's experimentation with different media. Here, he sprays metallic paint over the enamel for a shimmering painterly effect; subsequent spray drawings used only matte paint. The totemic structure of this proposed sculpture, made up of a few geometric elements along a vertical axis, coincided with what he was doing in his monumental steel sculptures.

Before long, he attracted the attention of André Breton, who in 1921 organized an exhibition in Paris of Ernst's collages. By 1922, Ernst had moved to the French capital, and never again worked in his native country. In 1924, in Paris, the thirty-three-year-old artist became one of the founding members of the Surrealist group.Ernst's Surrealist paintings are steeped in Freudian metaphor, private mythology, and childhood memories. One of his major themes centered on the image of the bird, which often incorporated human elements. Although some of these birds look benign, their mere presence appears to be ominous. He first coupled birds and windblown, apocalyptic animals in a series of small works entitled The Horde (1927), and he resumed the theme in 1935 in a series of even smaller paintings called The Barbarians, to which the present one belongs. In his biography of the artist, John Russell identified these creatures as expressions of Ernst's fearful anticipation of the impending devastation in Europe during World War II.In this small painting, a gigantic, malevolent-looking bird couple marches forward with seemingly mile-long strides. The dark female leads the way as her male companion turns to look at the strange animal-perhaps their offspring-clinging to his left arm. In the far distance, a tiny woman holds onto some undefined winged being. The strange patterns on the bodies of the main figures, which evoke fossils or geological formations, are the result of grattage (scraping). In this technique, the artist coated the canvas, or in this case, a piece of cardboard, with layers of paint and while it was still wet pressed it against objects that left imprints on the surface. Afterward, he used a brush to touch up the forms thus created, or scraped away layers of pigment.\", '')\n",

John T. Carpenter', 'Despite the renown of the Rinpa artist Sōtatsu (died ca. 1640), to whom a large number of stunningly beautiful paintings are attributed, he remains an elusive figure. Nothing is known of his background—except that his family name may have been Nonomura—or his early training. One letter written by him and occasional references to him or to his paintings by court nobles, essayists, artists, a tea master, and a novelist are the only documents that tell us anything about his life.[1]According to a genealogical chart in the possession of the Kataoka family, Sōtatsu married a cousin of Hon\\'ami Kōetsu (cat. nos. 83–85).[2]  He became the proprietor of a shop in Kyoto called Tawaraya, probably one of the many specialty shops mentioned in Momoyama literature that made and sold a variety of painted objects—fans, lantern paper, seashells for games, shikishi, and tanzaku. They also made screens and dolls, designed patterns for kimonos, and took commissions for decorating residential interiors. The earliest paintings attributed to Sōtatsu are the frontispieces and covers he made in 1602 as replacements for three scrolls of the Heike nōkyō, a set of twelfth-century sutras at the Itsukushima Shrine on Miyajima in the Inland Sea.[3]  These six modest works reveal features characteristic of Sōtatsu\\'s later paintings. They are without human figures and are limited to five landscapes and a design with a single deer. The landscape motifs are dramatically stylized abstract patterns, which later became a hallmark of the Rinpa school. And there is an emphasis on surface decoration, created by limiting the palette to gold and silver. The famous collaboration between Sōtatsu and the calligrapher Kōetsu seems to have begun a few years later. About 1606, Suminokura Sōan (1571–1632) launched the Sagabon (Saga Books), an ambitious project to publish handsome editions of classical literature. Sōtatsu decorated the paper to be used for the book covers and the texts with stamped designs, and Kōetsu and other calligraphers transcribed the text to be carved on wood stamps and then printed. After the Sagabon project, the two men collaborated on many other works (cat. nos. 83, 84). Sōtatsu had an important but secondary role in these projects, for paper designs were then viewed primarily as backgrounds for the calligraphy. With the exception of the well-known Deer Scroll, the motifs are limited to flowers and birds, usually seen at close range. Gold and silver predominate, with occasional touches of color, and some of the designs are stamped. None of the papers includes Sōtatsu\\'s signature, but a few show a seal reading \"Inen,\" a name that has come to be associated with the artist and his shop, Tawaraya. During the early years of the seventeenth century, the shop established a reputation for artistic excellence among cultivated and wealthy connoisseurs in Kyoto, and soon Sōtatsu was moving in such elevated circles that he was able to invite a leading tea master, Sen Shōan (1546–1614), to his own chanoyu.[4]  Kōetsu moved to Takagamine, on the outskirts of Kyoto, in 1615, but the collaboration between the two artists seems to have continued until about 1620, when Sōtatsu was recognized in his own right as a major painter. Sōtatsu was given the honorary title hokkyō, awarded to the master of a school or shop, probably after he had decorated the doors and screens for Yogen\\'in, a temple in Kyoto rebuilt in 1621 by order of the wife of Tokugawa Hidetada (r. 1605–23), the second Tokugawa shogun.[5]  On the large door panels at the temple, he painted pine trees and exotic animals—elephants, lions, and mythical beasts. Human figures do not appear in his oeuvre until much later. The earliest known reference to a narrative painting associated with Sōtatsu occurs in the Chikusai (1621–23), a humorous tale about a country doctor who visits Kyoto and Edo as a tourist.[6]  Isoda Michiharu, to whom the novel is attributed, mentions a Tawaraya fan painted in brilliant colors with episodes from the Genji monogatari. Sōtatsu relied exclusively on narrative themes drawn from classical literature as sources for his figure paintings, and the most innovative aspect of his work is the reuse, in a totally new context, of pictorial elements borrowed from ancient handscrolls.[7]  Sōtatsu\\'s interest in classical themes and in the native yamato-e style may have been stimulated by his association with Karasumaru Mitsuhiro (1579–1638), an eccentric and highly cultivated court noble well known for his interest in classical literature, who is said to have studied calligraphy with Kōetsu. That Sōtatsu and Mitsuhiro worked together is documented in a colophon of 1630 attached to a set of scrolls with a painting of the priest Saigyo (1118–1190; see cat. no. 79). The set is now dispersed among the Idemitsu Museum of Arts, Tokyo, and other collections. In the colophon Mitsuhiro attests that he wrote the text for the handscrolls, that Sōtatsu painted the pictures, and that their model was a set of Saigyō scrolls in the Imperial Collection.[8]Sōtatsu\\'s reputation reached its height about 1630, after he had painted screens for Emperor Go-Mizunoo (r. 1611–29). The artist\\'s death is not recorded, but he probably died about 1640; the title hokkyō was traditionally passed on to a successor when the master died, and sometime between 1639 and 1642 it was inherited by an artist named Sōsetsu (fl. 1639–50). This small polychrome album leaf illustrates an episode from the tenth-century Ise monogatari (Tales of Ise), which ranks with the Genji monogatari as one of Japan\\'s great literary classics.[9] The tale is composed of poems interspersed with narrative vignettes in prose that describe the travels in Japan of a gentleman identified only as \"a man.\" Most of the verses are love poems exchanged between the anonymous hero and various ladies whom he encounters. The scene represented here illustrates an episode in chapter 9 that recounts a journey to eastern Japan. The passage, known as \"Utsu no yama\" (Mount Utsu), includes the poem that is inscribed on the painting: Utsu no yamabe noutsutsu nimo yume nimohito ni awanu narikeriBeside Mount Utsuin Suruga,I can see youneither wakingnor, alas, even in my dreams.[10] The painting still preserves almost all the original pigments—red, brown, gold, and brilliant greens and blues. Rocks and hills, painted without ink outlines, are soft, round forms characteristic of Sōtatsu. A zigzag path, the defining element in the composition, is emphasized by the placement of a figure at each of three sharp bends. A triangular area of plain gold overwritten with fluid calligraphic lines at the upper right serves to counterbalance the massive horse and the attendant at the lower left. Carrying a wood box on his back, the wandering ascetic is seen walking away from the courtier after their encounter. Forty-seven shikishi illustrating episodes from the Ise monogatari and attributed to Sōtatsu and members of his studio are known today.[11]  All but five include a short poem. Most likely, they were originally pasted in an album. They may, however, have belonged to two different sets of illustrations, as two of them have identical compositions, though only one is accompanied by text. When some of the shikishi were remounted and the paper backing was removed, seventeen names of calligraphers were discovered, including that of Takeuchi Toshiharu (1611–1647), the name on the leaf in the Burke Collection.[12]  The biographical records of the calligraphers indicate that the shikishi were worked on in 1634 and again sometime between 1648 and 1651. The Ise monogatari was a popular subject for the artists of the later Rinpa school (see pages 308–9). Illustrations were already common in the eleventh century, and they are mentioned in the \"E-awase\" (Picture Competition) chapter of the Genji monogatari, though none from the Heian period has survived. The earliest extant examples are a few fragments from the Kamakura period. The printed editions of the Ise monogatari published in the seventeenth century as part of the Sagabon project (see cat. no. 83) include the earliest complete sets; we know, however, that a late Kamakura handscroll was still complete in 1838, when seven Kano artists collaborated in copying it. The copy, now in the Tokyo National Museum, preserves the complete text and all the pictures of the lost original, as well as the colophon added to the scroll in 1636 by Karasumaru Mitsuhiro, the court noble who frequently collaborated with Sōtatsu.[13]  Mitsuhiro states in the colophon that he examined the original in 1636, and he dates the scroll to the late Kamakura period. In view of the fact that the illustrations in the Sagabon edition are distinctly different from those in the nineteenth-century copy of the Kamakura scroll, it is clear that there were at least two traditions for the Ise pictures. It is possible that when Mitsuhiro examined the Kamakura scroll, Sōtatsu copied the pictures and later adapted them for his own Ise compositions. Some leaves from the group of forty-seven clearly derive from the Kamakura compositions; others are related to the Sagabon illustrations. The episode illustrated in the Burke shikishi is modeled after the Sagabon version, with slight changes in the poses of the three figures inspired by earlier emaki.[14] Sōtatsu\\'s composition became very popular with many later Rinpa artists—among them Ogata Korin (cat. nos. 132, 133), Fukae Roshū (1699–1757), and Sakai Hōitsu (cat. no. 134). The \"Utsu no yama\" shikishi in the Burke Collection is regarded as one of the finest of the forty-seven Ise leaves. It is therefore most likely by the master himself.

      "('http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/53177', \"Bishamonten is the Guardian King of the North, one of the four fierce protectors of the cardinal directions (Shitennō). Originally Hindu gods known as the Lokapalas, the four were adopted into the Indian Buddhist pantheon at an early point in its history. The four guardians—Jikokuten (Sanskrit: Dhrtarashtra) of the east, Kōmokuten (Virupaksha) of the west, Zōchōten (Virudhaka) of the south, and Bishamonten or Tamonten of the north—were in turn absorbed into the Mikkyō pantheon. In group representations, Bishamonten is usually identified by the miniature stupa—both a symbol of the Buddhist Law and a special treasure granted him by the Buddha—that he holds in his right hand. This small, youthful, but stern Bishamonten stands firmly on two scowling demons, Niranba and Biranba. His miniature stupa is supported on his left palm, while in his right hand he grasps a long lance. The shift of the stupa from the right to the left hand when Bishamonten is represented alone seems to have been introduced in Mikkyō mandalas at the beginning of the ninth century, thus establishing a new canon. The present statue was originally brightly colored, with floral and geometric patterns in paint and kirikane covering the layers of robes and armor. The small, shining eyes are inlaid. The sculpture is made of several pieces of wood, and its interior is hollowed out. Stylistically, the piece especially resembles a triad of sculptures made by Tankei (1173–1256) for the temple Sekkenji in Shikoku, and may therefore be attributed to an artist who closely followed Tankei's style or model in the first half of the thirteenth century.

      "('http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/53439', 'Surrounded by billowing gold clouds, a large, gilded bridge sweeps across an expanse of dark blue water. A group of statuesque, beautifully dressed women and their young attendants sit or stand by the railings, preparing to toss painted fans into the river or watching already-discarded fans floating on the current below. The scene perhaps alludes to the custom of casting used summer fans into the river to celebrate the arrival of cooler autumn weather. Two bamboo baskets filled with stones, which protect the shoreline from erosion, are seen at the lower-right edge and, like the bridge, are fancifully depicted in gold. All of the fans—both those held in the figures’ hands and those floating on the river—bear painted scenes and designs, either narrative or decorative, revealing the unidentified artist’s Kano-school training. The women’s full, oblong faces and clearly delineated features also support such an attribution.', 'Surrounded by billowing gold clouds, a golden bridge sweeps across an expanse of dark blue water. Unlike the earlier Willows and Bridge (cat. no. 80), this screen has as its primary focus a group of eighteen stately women and their four young attendants. The figures stand or sit by the railings of the bridge; some watch the painted fans that float on the current below, while others appear about to cast their fans into the water. Two gilded bamboo baskets filled with stones, which protect the shoreline from soil erosion, can be seen at the edge of the river. The subject of this dramatic composition could perhaps have been identified by the scene depicted on the companion screen, now missing.[1]  The absent screen most likely depicted a house of pleasure. If this is the case, the women on the bridge would be professional courtesans, and the golden bridge would signify a path to \"paradise on earth.\" Here, on what was originally the left screen, we are presented with three groups of women: five figures at the extreme right viewing the fans on the water and two groups of women clustered along the railings in the center. Two of the women look across the bridge, creating a visual link with the other figures. Two attendants approach from the extreme left. One carries a long pipe, the other a tray laden with a box and two bottles. The attendant jauntily balancing the pipe over his shoulder may be a boy, as the red jacket appears to be a jinbaori (a jacket worn in military camps), a strictly male accoutrement. All the fans—both those held and those floating on the river—-have painted scenes and designs. Among the images is a famous episode from chapter 34, \"Wakana jō \" (New Herbs: Part One), of the Genji monogatari, which tells of the game that led to the tragic love affair between Genji\\'s young wife and the son of his best friend. The fans also depict flowers of different seasons, painted in bright colors on gold, and three feature subjects frequently chosen by Kano-school artists: a kingfisher on a tree branch and a family of musk cats among carnations (see also cat. no. 60 ). A fan painting of a large moon rising out of autumn grasses presents the popular yamato-e theme of Musashino, the plain west of Edo. Another, showing Mount Fuji and the beach of Miho lined with pines, typifies the traditional genre of meisho-e (pictures of famous places). Ōgi (folding fans) are thought to have evolved from the round Chinese fan during the Early Heian period. They served a variety of functions. Their primary use was, of course, to cool the owner in the heat of summer. Open, they could serve as trays. One type of fan had iron ribs that could be used by warriors as impromptu weapons.[2]  Fans were employed in games, and they were important props in the performing arts. While the earliest extant examples of painted fans elate to the mid-twelfth century, the earliest surviving illustrations of fans—from the Genji monogatari—date to the first quarter of the century. One of the important duties of painters in the service of the emperor or shogun was to make presentations of their fans at the beginning of each year. Ōgi eshi, painters of fans intended for the general public, and ōgiya, shops that produced and sold fans, became staples of city life. Records of ōgiya began to appear in the second half of the fourteenth century, and the shops were included in paintings of cities, such as rakuchū -rakugai screens (cat. no. 139). While used fans were generally discarded at the end of the summer, they were often kept for their sentimental value and pasted into albums or on folding screens. A screen ornamented with fans served as a kind of miniature museum, where many paintings could be viewed at the same time. The earliest pictorial evidence for the practice of arranging fans on screens is a scene from the Boki ekotoba, an illustrated biography of the monk Kakunyo dating to 1482 in the collection of Nishi Honganji, Kyoto.[3]  Many screens with painted fans—some of which are not actually fans but fan-shaped paintings—have background designs of autumn grasses. It was also popular to paste (or paint) fans over a background of flowing water, a type of imagery that may have evolved from the medieval pastime of casting fans into the water to float on the surface. References to such screens first appear in literature of the fifteenth century.[4]Screens painted with the fans-and-stream motif were often installed in shogunal residences. A story that appears in the Ansai zui-hitsu (Essays by Ansai), a collection of essays on miscellaneous subjects by the antiquarian Ise Sadatake ( 1717–1784), suggests one explanation for this fashion.[5]  According to the tale, an Ashikaga shogun of the Muromachi period was on his way to the Kyoto temple of Tenryūji when one of his pages accidentally dropped his master\\'s fan into the Ōi River from the bridge, Togetsukyō. Taking their cue from the page, all the other members of the shogun\\'s retinue followed suit and tossed their fans into the water. It is not unlikely that the story derives from a painting. On the other hand, the tale itself may have inspired the creation of a type of screen composition known as senmen nagashi (fans afloat).[6]As noted above, several of the floating fans reveal the artist\\'s Kano-school training. Most early examples of genre painting are associated with Kano artists, and the school\\'s contributions to the development of genre imagery are widely recognized. The full, oblong faces and clearly delineated features of the women in the Burke screen also support an attribution to a Kano artist. The figures on the bridge wear their hair flowing loosely or tied simply at the nape of the neck. Both styles, prevalent among young women during the Momoyama period, predate the more elaborate coiffures that appear in the genre paintings of a slightly later period.[7]  The presence of the long smoking pipes tells us that the screen could not have been painted before 1605, when smoking first became popular following its introduction by a Spanish missionary visiting Japan in 1601.[8]The designs on the women\\'s clothing are dominated by stripes, small patterns, and overall tie-dyed motifs. The sharply contrasting patterns, segregated from other motifs in large areas at the top and bottom, were known as kata suso (shoulders and hems); these predate the more ostentatious, eye-catching designs that appear in paintings beginning in the early seventeenth century. This change in fashion is documented by records of orders kept by the ancestors of Ogata Kōrin (cat. nos. 132, 133), who owned a highly successful textile shop, Kariganeya, which produced material for kimonos and catered to the shoguns and members of the royal family. An account of the shop\\'s commissions from 1602 and 1603 reflects the popular demand for kata suso patterns.[9]  Kariganeya\\'s record book includes notes on the most fashionable colors for garments at the time: white and light blue are the most frequently mentioned. The browns, dark reds, and other somber colors that also appear in the Burke screen forecast the change in textile design that took place during the second decade of the 1600s.[10]In summation, this screen, one of a small number of genre paintings dating to the early Edo period, may be attributed to an anonymous Kano artist active at the beginning of the seventeenth century.[Miyeko Murase 2000, Bridge of Dreams] [1] Curiously, two other screens with similar compositions are also missing their companion screens.

      "('http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/53443', 'A courtesan, statuesque and regal in pose, has paused her procession to glance back, perhaps to acknowledge an admirer. Kaigetsudō Ando was the founder of a studio of artists that produced woodblock prints and paintings of the high-ranking women of the demimonde. Here a poem card (shikishi) is inscribed with a poem attributed to Sarumaru Dayu (active late 8th century) that was made famous through its inclusion in One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets (Hyakunin isshu): Oku yama ni momiji fumi-wake naku shika no koe kiku toki zo aki wa kanashiki Deep in the mountains,traipsing through leaves,a deer cries for its mate—when I hear that sound,it’s autumn at its saddest.—Trans. John T. Carpenter', 'The imposing figure of a courtesan here fills the picture plane, her body arched in an S-curve as she lifts the hem of her kimono and glances over her shoulder, showing her costume and her full, white face to best advantage. The painting has the quality of a fashion plate, and its appeal is frankly sensuous. The colophon at the upper right corner, brushed by an anonymous calligrapher on a shikishi (poem sheet), is a familiar classical poem attributed to Sarumaru Dayū, a monk of the Early Heian period and one of the Thirty-six Immortal Poets (see cat. nos. 39–41). The poem is included in the Kokinshū and other anthologies. Okuyama ni momiji fumiwake naku shika no koe kiku toki zu aki wa kanashiki  Treading through the autumn leaves in the deepest mountains, I hear the belling of the lonely deer—then it is that autumn is sad.[1] The scroll bears the signature \"Nihon giga Kaigetsudō\" (Playfully Painted by Japan\\'s Kaigetsudō). Because the numerous paintings and woodblock prints with this signature usually include an additional name or seal as well, \"Kaigetsudō\" is believed to have been a studio name. Tall, majestic women were the favorite subject of this studio, and all Kaigetsudō courtesans are remarkably similar. A woman is shown standing alone adjusting her hair or looking back over her shoulder. The faces are stereotypes, seldom revealing individuality or emotion. The costumes reflect popular fashions in textile designs and are strongly outlined in rhythmic curves that set off the large, clearly defined patterns and lively color contrasts. The basic costume design—the position of the sleeves, the shape of the obi, and the flare of the lower hem—is often repeated in many works, varied only by different textile patterns. Such paintings were mass-produced, and the same shop would make cheaper woodcut versions of them in monochrome. Various signatures and seals on the paintings and prints differentiate six Kaigetsudō artists: Ando, Anchi, Dohan, Doshin (cat. no. 147), Doshu, and Doshū. Ando is generally credited with founding the studio. This painting includes, in addition to the \"Kaigetsudō\" signature, a seal reading \"Ando\" and another seal frequently found with it, which can be deciphered as \"Kan\\'unshi.\" Ando\\'s successors made woodblock prints of these women, but no print is associated with Ando himself. Kaigetsudō Ando is known to have used another name, \"Kaigetsudō Jōsen,\" and to have sold his pictures to visitors to the Yoshiwara pleasure district in Edo.[2]  His real name was Okazaki (or Okazawa) Genshichi, and he was acquainted with the inner circle of women who served members of the Tokugawa shogunate. Implicated in a scandal involving a love affair between one of the women and a Kabuki actor—a serious criminal offense—he was ordered into exile in 1714. Paintings by Ando found on the remote islands south of Tokyo indicate that he was sent either to Niijima or to Ōshima. He remained there until 1722.[3]  It is generally assumed that this incident ended Ando\\'s painting career and that his shop was continued by his pupils, who signed their names \"Kaigetsudō matsuyō\" (the last leaf of Kaigetsudō). The few paintings by Ando that survive suggest that he was trained in a fairly orthodox school. A handscroll in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, exhibits his familiarity with the Kano style and an interest in nanga (see pages 373–74), which was then emerging as new painting style.[4]  Ando\\'s images of solitary courtesans mark the height of a style of figure painting that began in the early seventeenth century and would subsequently be refined by Hishikawa Moronobu (ca. 1618–1694).

      "('http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/54678', 'Tsakali cards were used by itinerant teachers moving from one monastery to another in order to evoke Vajrayana Buddhist deities. When laid on the ground in the form of a mandala, as seen here, they functioned to create a fixed sacred space like that of a temple. The deities shown on these initiation cards include the Tathagata Buddhas, various bodhisattvas, fierce protectors, and the six possible realms of rebirth seen across the bottom. They probably were made by a Nepali artist for a Tibetan patron of the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism.Tsakali cards were used individually to align a disciple with a deity from the vast pantheon. First, the disciple sought permission from the deity, either through a dream or under the guidance of a teacher. The associated ritual involved visualizing the deity as described in recited mantras (incantations) and with an image—in this case, the deity represented on the tsakali.The cards form a mandala if the first one is placed in the middle and the following cards are arranged clockwise, as is auspicious. The bodhisattvas Samantabhadra (male) and Sambantabhadri (female), appearing in the upper corners, have as their esoteric counterpart the central and most important figure, Vajrasattva. While there is no text explaining this mandala, the Maha Vairochana sutra tells us that Vajrasattva should be venerated in order to purify the mind prior to undertaking advanced tantric techniques. This accords with the inscriptions on the back of each card, which associate mental states with each deity and delusions, such as pride, jealousy, and hatred, with each of the possible rebirths. It is remarkable that these cards, perhaps the earliest set of tsakali that survives intact, together form a mandala suitable for the ritual of initiation.', '')\n",

      "('http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/658692', 'This footed goblet provides an ideal bridge between the burgeoning Arts and Crafts movement championed by Morris and Company and the endeavors of James Powell & Sons’ Whitefriars Glassworks to encourage modern, British design in glassware. The goblet was designed by Philip Webb in 1860, as part of a series of table glasses with spiral trails for William Morris’s home, the Red House. Made by James Powell & Sons, the series of glassware was also sold through Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. Harry Powell (grandson of the wine-merchant, James Powell, who had purchased the Whitefriars Glassworks in 1834) and principal designer at Whitefriars singled out this group of designs for special comment, illustrating this goblet design in an article in the Architectural Review in 1899. At that time, such were the Whitefriars’ records of the commission that Harry Powell believed the designer to have been Morris himself. Following a visit to the Whitefriars Glassworks by the future director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, Sydney Cockerell (at that time, still Morris & Co.’s manager) this mistake was rectified (on a postcard preserved in the Museum of London, acc. 3312) and when Harry Powell mentioned the Red House glassware designs in his revised entry for \"Glass\" in the Encyclopedia Britannica in 1906, he ascribed them to Webb. Harry Powell also sketched this goblet design amongst the series of designs annotated as \"by Philip Webb for William Morris for the Red House at Upton\" in his design notebook logging \"Glasses with Histories\", made around 1912 onwards (preserved in the Museum of London, acc. 3252). The page of this notebook illustrating this goblet’s design is illustrated by W. Evans, C. Ross & A. Werner, Whitefriars Glass. James Powell & Sons of London, London: Museum of London, 1995 (plate 422, p.275). Very soon after Whitefriars first produced this group of glassware designed by Webb, Christopher Dresser admired it, in 1862, calling attention to its \"simplicity of treatment\".', '')\n",

Watkins’s 1864 diary recounts that he sold stereo views on paper mounts for one dollar and that mammothplate prints were five dollars. Other San Francisco photographers as well as large East Coast wholesalers of photographs such E. and H. T. Anthony published and sold views of Yosemite for as little as a dollar a dozen. Made from a precipitous perspective at about six thousand feet, this thrilling view makes use of the stereo effect (seeming three-dimensionality) by employing distinctive foreground, middle-ground, and background elements.

      "('http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/670830', 'This deluxe surimono (privately published woodblock print) captures an intriguing scene of women gathering at pavilion on a snowy day during the New Year’s season.  Two women—one in an unusual straw cloak, and the other carrying a sotoba (wooden grave marker)— approach the pavilion, which has the name Jinjitsutei over the gateway.  Seen through a circular window, two women and a child inside are about to enjoy some tea by a writing table. In the garden, an old plum tree serves as symbol of approaching spring.  Prints such as these were usually produced as New Year’s greetings cards to be privately distributed by members of poetry groups. Often pictures for surimono include allusions to classical literature, which may be the case here.  The name of the pavilion Jinjitsutei indicated on the sign over the gate is derived from the poetry name of the poet Jinjitsutei Tabirako who contributed the kyōka (31-syllable verse) at the top left. We can assume that he commissioned this print, and that other poets, including Jōken Katatsura, Hananoya Michiyori, are members of the same poetry group. The poet on the far right signs himself “Shōsadō Shunman,” which is an alternative name used by Kubo Shunman, a surimono designer and producer, as well as a leading kyōka poet of the day.', '')\n",

The court cards for the suits of Falcons and Ducks are male while those for Hounds and Stags are female. This segregating of the sexes may seem odd to us now, but a description of playing cards written in 1377 noted a pack of fifty-two with just such a sequence. The imagery of the Stuttgart cards implies two different types of hunts. The kings and their courts preside over the falcons, which were trained to strike their prey (in this case, ducks), while the queens and their courts dominate the hounds, which were used to bring down large game (here stags). The birds and animals in the pip cards are vibrant and lifelike, suggesting observation of nature and knowledge of various types of hunts. The face cards, on the other hand, have scant connection to any aspect of the hunt. The childlike figures with round, smooth faces project the insouciance of a world free from worry or strife. The queens remain comfortably indoors, whereas the rest of the court figures occupy shallow strips of pleasant greenery against a shimmering gold backdrop that provides a glittering shield against the world beyond. The youthful, elegant court figures evince the innocence and vitality of a privileged people untroubled by coarse quotidian concerns. Thus, in this deck the hunt serves as a metaphor for a world where man and beast cohabit in concord, where the cares of life evaporate—a blissful idyll with little basis in late medieval reality.Suits: Falcons, Ducks, Hounds, and Stags13 cards in each suit: Falcons and Ducks: King, Upper Knave, Under Knave, Banner (10), 9 through 1.

The Courtly Hunt Cards (Das Hofjagdspiel)This luxury set of painted playing cards once belonged to Archduke Ferdinand II of Austria (brother of Emperor Maximilian II) and was kept in the Kunstkammer he created at Schloß Ambras, near Innsbruck, sometime after 1567. Unlike many German examples, this deck has fifty-six rather than the more conventional forty-eight or fifty-two cards. Collectively, the suit symbols represent the progression of a particular type of hunt. The falcon strikes and kills the heron, the hound retrieves the heron, and the lures attract the falcon back to the falconer. The kings and queens are all set against a gold ground, but reds and blues dominate the backgrounds of the rest of the cards in each suit. In the face cards, the images were first drawn in pen and ink, then the green turf was sprinkled with flowers, and the backgrounds were painted. Most of the heads and hands are sketched in but left unpainted. A number of horses are highly finished, but others were left nearly or completely unfinished. The suit symbols of Herons and Hounds are drawn so expressively and with such control and economy of line that they appear to be finished drawings in their own right, but a light wash of blue over the necks and heads of the herons in the lower values indicates that they were intended to be painted. Why some cards were left incomplete is unknown. On the basis of style, these cards have long been attributed to the workshop of Konrad Witz, who was born in Rottweil in southern Germany and became a member of the painters’ guild in Basel in 1434.Suits: Falcons, Herons, Hounds, and Lures14 cards in each suit: King, Queen, Upper Knave, Under Knave, Banner (10), 9 through 156 cards, of which 54 surviveKunsthistorisches Museum Wien, Kunstkammer (KK 5018–5071)', '')\n",

The deck is structured according to the hierarchy of officials and functionaries in a late medieval court, from those of the highest rank down to the lowest. There are four suits: heraldic shields blazoned with the arms of the kingdoms of Germany, Bohemia, Hungary, and France. Each suit is led by a king and a queen, followed by a master of the household (10) and a marshal (9), with a fool (1) at the bottom—two male and two female. A lady-in-waiting (6) appears in all four suits. The rest of the pip cards (8, 7, 5, 4, 3, and 2) are all court functionaries or purveyors of descending ranks and are different in every suit—except the 4 of Bohemia and the 4 of Hungary, which are both mounted trumpeters—for a total of twenty- three subordinates. These range from a medical doctor and a cupbearer, to a falconer and a cook, to a court tailor and a fishmonger, to a barber and a potter. The deck is a unique compendium of secular woodblock prints of a quality unsurpassed at this early date. The articulated lines are cut to a remarkable thinness with assured fluidity. The coloring of the figures and of their surrounds is executed with a painterly refinement. Great care is given to the detailing of costumes, fabrics, and appurtenances, while decorative elements are richly enhanced with applied gold and silver, frequently embellished with punchwork that scatters reflected light. Some correspondences with the engravings by the Master ES have long been noted, supporting an attribution to the Upper Rhineland, but other scholars have argued that the cards may have been produced in Austria—perhaps Vienna.Suits: Germany, Bohemia, Hungary, and France12 cards in each suit: King, Queen, Master of the Household (10), Marshal (9), 8 and 7 (all different figures), Lady-in-Waiting (6), 5 through 2 (all different figures), Fool (1)48 cards, of which 48 surviveKunsthistorisches Museum Wien, Kunstkammer (KK 5077–5124)', '')\n",

He was a painter and a prolific draftsman, and he produced more than twelve hundred woodcuts, which are famed for their wit and epigrammatic content. In his deck of playing cards, the kings, following convention, sit holding their suit signs or gesturing toward them. The knaves, on the other hand, are more socially stratified: the upper knaves are elegantly turned out, while the attire of the under knaves ranges from modest to rags. Schäufelein’s scenes in the lower zones of the pip cards present a more forthright view of the social condition. Some merely depict pleasantries among the denizens of the upper strata. Most, however, underscore the uncouth, even salacious behavior of farmers and peasants or, more generally, the foibles and failings of mankind expressed through imagery loaded with sardonic, proverbial, or moralizing messages. In the 6 of Bells, an old woman gazes at a glass vessel, emulating the charlatan practice of analyzing urine. She is conducting a pregnancy test; the urine bottle she contemplates, however, holds a mound of feces, the only thing this woman is likely to give birth to. Other images merely underscore the foolishness of human behavior. In the 10 of Bells, a man serenades a hare with a fife and drum, and, in the 8 of Bells, a woman attempts to milk a bull to its obvious disconcertment. A master of economy, Schäufelein created compositions with taut line and narrative conciseness that convey the essence of each image with arresting directness. Schäufelein seems to have assembled an almost arbitrary selection of images poking fun at humanity’s failings, arranged in no particular order, as though the random dealing of cards were a metaphor of life’s vicissitudes.Suits: Acorns, Leafs, Hearts, and Bells13 cards in each suit: King, Upper Knave, Under Knave, 10 through 152 cards, of which 48 surviveGermanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg (GNM Sp 7074-7120 Kapsel 516)King of BellsThe king sits in a carriage.Upper Knave of BellsThe Upper Knave is portrayed as a mercenary.[The Under Knave of Bells is missing.]10 of BellsA man entertains a hare with fife and drum.9 of BellsA man blows a pipe up the rear of a dog.8 of BellsA woman attempts to milk a bull.7 of BellsA woman plays with a bear.6 of BellsA female charlatan examines feces in a urine glass.5 of BellsA donkey bears a heavy sack with a glass vessel on its head and wears a bell around its neck.4 of BellsA fox with a basket of cockerels strapped to his back walks along with two walking sticks.3 of BellsA man lying on the ground swats at flies while a bird raises a fuss.2 of BellsTwo couples enjoy a copious meal outdoors.1 of BellsA man with his hand up a woman’s skirt is fended off with a distaff as another attacks with a stick.', '')\n",

The cards were hand painted and enhanced with gold. The backs of the cards are inscribed with musical notations and lyrics, with each suit given a particular voice: Acorns, bass; Leafs, tenor; Hearts, treble; and Bells, alto. Each suit is headed by men alone: a king, an upper knave, and an under knave. The suits each have loose thematic connections. In Acorns, five of the pip cards deal with the scatological antics of pigs, which in popular culture were equated with gluttony and lust. In Leafs, several scenes are devoted to the capers of farmers or peasants, underscoring their reputation for drunken and licentious behavior. Hearts are concerned primarily with the pastimes of the bourgeoisie and the lack of chastity. And in Bells, a number of scenes address folly, vanity, and the futility of foolish behavior. The droll lucidity of his images is a pungent reminder that card playing spawns all types of sin, effectively justifying the denunciations of the clergy and civil authorities. But in another sense, these scenes may be seen as the final flourish of imagery that developed out of the monstrous, bawdy, topsy-turvy drolleries that abound in the marginalia of fourteenth-century manuscripts. In the crude subject matter of the cards, Flötner acknowledged man’s baser instincts while warning against them. These striking cards bring to life a microcosmic view of a world long gone while animating social and moral themes that still resonate today. More than any other artist, Flötner fully exploited the conceit of playing cards as a visual polemic to convey his worldview.Suits: Acorns, Leafs, Hearts, and Bells12 cards in each suit: King, Upper Knave, Under Knave, Banner (10), 9 through 248 cards, of which 47 survive Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg (GMN Sp 7418 1-47 Kapsel 516)King of AcornsThe king greatly resembles the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I.Upper Knave of AcornsThe Upper Knave is portrayed as a mercenary.Under Knave of AcornsThe messenger has a letter in his hand, and a hare and a sausage hang from a branch over his shoulder.Banner (10) of AcornsA seated lady holds the banner.9 of AcornsTwo pigs play trictrac (a version of backgammon); a mound of feces on the edge of the board is apparently the prize.8 of AcornsTwo pigs roast a large mass of fecal matter on a spit over a cushion sitting in open flames.7 of AcornsTwo pigs eat filth off a large charger.6 of AcornsA fool playing a fiddle leads two strolling patrician couples.5 of AcornsIn a coarse parody of the Saint George legend, a hunchbacked dwarf on a goat attacks a pig with a lance; a female onlooker holds a wreath, the victor’s prize, in her hand.4 of AcornsA woman takes her hunchbacked daughter to a doctor to assess her marriage prospects; the learned man examines a urine bottle for a prediction and sees only feces. 3 of AcornsIn a coarse visual play on the traditional scene of two angels carrying a soul up to heaven on a bolt of linen, two pigs have a tug-of-war with a cloth in their maws loaded with a mound of feces.', '')\n",

They are the earliest known intaglio prints and were made from engraved copperplates. The figures are brilliantly modeled, with fine parallel lines creating a masterful play of light and shadow as well as sculptural volume. The artist’s sure control of both the burin and the stylus (tools used to incise the copperplate) suggests he had traditional training as a goldsmith, whereas his painterly style with a skilled command of line and tonality may well be indicative of experience in a painter’s workshop. Scholars have often noted distinct affinities with Konrad Witz (whose workshop made The Courtly Hunt Cards) both in the plastic treatment of figures and in his close observation of nature. The pip cards, with values indicated by the number of repetitions of the suit sign, vary in both the choice of the symbols (there are variant forms) and their placement. The face cards were produced with a suitless image for each of the four ranks, to which a suit symbol could be added. Theoretically, the same suitless face card could be used for all five suits, which eliminated the need for a separate plate for each figure, but the Master of the Playing Cards also created an individual face card for each suit; thus numerous combinations were possible in different decks.

Note also how each rose takes a variant form. The Playing Cards by the Master of the Playing CardsAn anonymous Upper Rhenish artist known as the Master of the Playing Cards produced these engraved cards—a considerably less costly alternative to hand-painted decks. They are the earliest known intaglio prints and were made from engraved copperplates. The figures are brilliantly modeled, with fine parallel lines creating a masterful play of light and shadow as well as sculptural volume. The artist’s sure control of both the burin and the stylus (tools used to incise the copperplate) suggests he had traditional training as a goldsmith, whereas his painterly style with a skilled command of line and tonality may well be indicative of experience in a painter’s workshop. Scholars have often noted distinct affinities with Konrad Witz (whose workshop made The Courtly Hunt Cards) both in the plastic treatment of figures and in his close observation of nature. The pip cards, with values indicated by the number of repetitions of the suit sign, vary in both the choice of the symbols (there are variant forms) and their placement. The face cards were produced with a suitless image for each of the four ranks, to which a suit symbol could be added. Theoretically, the same suitless face card could be used for all five suits, which eliminated the need for a separate plate for each figure, but the Master of the Playing Cards also created an individual face card for each suit; thus numerous combinations were possible in different decks. Of the seventy-some impressions known, only one actually mounted as a card and hand-colored has survived.Suits: Stags, Birds, Beasts of Prey (Bears and Lions), Wild Men, and Flowers (Roses, Cyclamen, and Pinks)12 (?) cards in each suit: King, Queen, Upper Knave, Under Knave, 9 through 2; apparently no Banner (10) or 1Original number of cards is uncertain, possibly 48', '')\n",

In the early 1460s, he produced two sets of engraved playing cards, The Small Playing Cards and The Large Playing Cards. As in The Courtly Hunt Cards, each suit of the small deck has four face cards: king, queen, upper knave, and under knave; the pip cards run from 9 through 1, fifty-two in all. Both decks were copied within a decade by the Netherlandish engraver Israhel van Meckenem.Suits: Men, Hounds, Birds, and Shields12 cards in each suit: King, Queen, Upper Knave, Under Knave, 9 through 248 cards, of which about 41 survive', '')\n",

      "('http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/679085', 'Tsakali cards were used by itinerant teachers moving from one monastery to another in order to evoke Vajrayana Buddhist deities. When laid on the ground in the form of a mandala, as seen here, they functioned to create a fixed sacred space like that of a temple. The deities shown on these initiation cards include the Tathagata Buddhas, various bodhisattvas, fierce protectors, and the six possible realms of rebirth seen across the bottom. They probably were made by a Nepali artist for a Tibetan patron of the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism.Tsakali cards were used individually to align a disciple with a deity from the vast pantheon. First, the disciple sought permission from the deity, either through a dream or under the guidance of a teacher. The associated ritual involved visualizing the deity as described in recited mantras (incantations) and with an image—in this case, the deity represented on the tsakali.The cards form a mandala if the first one is placed in the middle and the following cards are arranged clockwise, as is auspicious. The bodhisattvas Samantabhadra (male) and Sambantabhadri (female), appearing in the upper corners, have as their esoteric counterpart the central and most important figure, Vajrasattva. While there is no text explaining this mandala, the Maha Vairochana sutra tells us that Vajrasattva should be venerated in order to purify the mind prior to undertaking advanced tantric techniques. This accords with the inscriptions on the back of each card, which associate mental states with each deity and delusions, such as pride, jealousy, and hatred, with each of the possible rebirths. It is remarkable that these cards, perhaps the earliest set of tsakali that survives intact, together form a mandala suitable for the ritual of initiation.', '')\n",
